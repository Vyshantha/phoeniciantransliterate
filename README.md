# Transliterator between Phoenician, Punic (𐤐𐤕) and Latin script
An application that can work both online and offline (once the website is loaded on the browser) on the [Phoenician Transliterate](https://vyshantha.github.io/phoeniciantransliterate/) website. 

Application can run on any type of device : ```Mobile, Tablet, Desktops and Laptops``` on operating systems like ```Android, Apple iOS, Apple Mac, Microsoft Windows and Linux``` on browsers such as ```Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, Opera and Brave```.

The application completes transliteration of texts pasted or typed into the text area from Phoenician 𐤐𐤕 script to Latin script and from Latin script to Phoneician 𐤐𐤕 script.

The languages ```Phoenician, Punic, Ammonite, Moabite, Edomite``` written in Phoenician 𐤐𐤕 script are supported with this application.

- To change the transliteration direction i.e. to switch between Latin or Phoenician, click the swap icon  <img src="./swap-horiz-64.png" width="40px" height="40px" />
